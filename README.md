# RUL Prediction with GRU RNN

This project predicts the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of NASA CMAPPS using a GRU-based RNN.

## File Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw data files.
- `src/`: Core code files.
- `results/`: Stores plots and model checkpoints.
- `evaluate.py`: Main script to run the pipeline (trains and tests).

## Setup
1. Install dependencies
2. Copy data path to load_and_split_data function in evaluate.py
3. Run evaluate.py
